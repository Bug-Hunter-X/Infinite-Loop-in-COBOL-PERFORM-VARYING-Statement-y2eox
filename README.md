This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in COBOL: an infinite loop caused by a flawed PERFORM VARYING statement.  The `bug.cob` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.cob` provides the corrected version.  The error arises from the possibility of the loop condition never being met, leading to unexpected program behavior and potential crashes.  The solution introduces appropriate checks and a safety mechanism to prevent the infinite loop.
